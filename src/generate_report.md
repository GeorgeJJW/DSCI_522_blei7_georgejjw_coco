Chocolate bar is one of the most popular treats around the world, but
not all chocolate bars are made the same. Some chocolate bars are more
concentrated in terms of cocoa and are more bitter, while some chocolate
bars are less concentrated and are lighter flavoured.

This begs a question - are chocolate bars that are more concentrated
also means that they are simply better chocolate bars? In other words,
are chocolate bars that are 99% pure better than chocolate bars that are
only 79% pure?

This analysis will explore the relationship between chocolate darkness
(cocoa percentage) and chocolate expert ratings.

#### Data set

We will examine the expert ratings of 1,795 chocolate bars that were
compiled by Brady Brelinski, a Founding Member of the [Manhattan
Chooclate Society](http://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html). This data set
is hosted on
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings).
